#### Fakes
Fakes are objects, which you can use in place of real methods. They are invoked, receive parameters, and can return values, just like real methods. As far as the invokee is concerned, it _is_ the real method you intended to be executed in your code. Fakes are what Rooibos uses under the hood, to facilitate it's Stub and Mock implementations.
